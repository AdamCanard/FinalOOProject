This is a library management system, our solution to your everyday library experience. Our goal is to improve the customer and librarian experience, we have simplified the system to Books, Users, Rentals, and Fines. Librarians will use our software to input new books, edit existing books, add users and edit users. Customers can search our library catelog and borrow books. Books are rented for 7 days to all students and 14 days to all instructors, If a customer cant return a book in their allotted time, they may approach the librarian who can extend the rental period for you. If you fail to return your book you will be issued a fine which must be payed before they can borrow another book.
